# Agricultural-Production-Optimization-Engine
In this project I have build a predictive model so as to suggest the most suitable crops to grow based on the available climatic and soil conditions.

~ This project is intended on precision farming.

~ We have to optimize productivity by understanding requirements of climatic and soil conditions for crops.

~ This model helps us to cope up with weather unpredictability.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook.

Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, ipywidgets and sklearn.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Clustering Analysis and Logistic Regression.
